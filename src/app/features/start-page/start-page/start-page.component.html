      You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!
    </p>
    <p class="description__item">
      Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

    <h3 class="description__item">RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="description__item">1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
      <li class="description__item">2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
      <li class="description__item">3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
      <li class="description__item">4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
